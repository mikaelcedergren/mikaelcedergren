    <h1><span>Unlocking Creativity</span> - A Simple Guide to Brainstorming</h1>
</header>

<section id="blog-post">
    <ingress>Many believe creativity is an innate gift — something you either have or don't. However, creativity can be nurtured and structured to yield remarkable results.</ingress>
    <p>Consider the invention of Velcro. In 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral noticed how burrs clung to his dog's fur during a walk. This seemingly trivial observation led him to develop Velcro, a revolutionary fastening system inspired by nature. With the right approach, anyone can tap into their creative potential.</p>
    <p>Here's how to harness that creativity through structured brainstorming:</p>

    <h2>Phase 1: Anything Goes</h2>
    <p>Begin by organizing a brainstorming session open to all, regardless of their role or self-perceived creativity. Set the tone by emphasizing that no idea is too outlandish and that participants should think without limitations. Thinking of restrictions at this point is strictly forbidden.</p>
    <p>As ideas are shared, document each one visibly, such as on a whiteboard, ensuring everyone can see and read them throughout the process. This inclusivity encourages participation and shows that every contribution is valued. But also something that will be very valuable later.</p>
    <p>Pay attention to quieter participants. Gently invite them to share their thoughts, creating a safe environment where they feel comfortable speaking up. If any criticism arises, remind the group that this phase is about generating ideas, not evaluating them.</p>
    <p>The goal here is to gather a diverse array of ideas, from the practical to the fantastical, without judgment.</p>

    <h2>Phase 2: Shape the Ideas</h2>
    <p>With a collection of ideas, begin to organize and refine them. Look for connections between concepts and explore how they might be combined or expanded. Discuss which ideas resonate with the group and hold potential.</p>
    <p>This phase involves open discussion, building upon the initial ideas to give them more structure. It's about molding the raw material into more defined concepts, without yet worrying about feasibility.</p>

    <h2>Phase 3: Make It Work</h2>
    <p>Now, introduce practical considerations. Evaluate the refined ideas based on available resources, time, and feasibility. Determine which concepts can realistically be implemented in your current context.</p>
    <p>Revisit the original problem to ensure the proposed solutions address it effectively. This step ensures that the creative process remains aligned with the initial goals.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>By following these phases, you can unlock creativity in any group, leading to innovative solutions and fresh perspectives. You also create the opportunity to discover hidden gems—those seemingly crazy ideas that, with a little refining, turn out to be feasible.</p>
    <p>Without opening everyone’s minds at the start, the true potential of these ideas might have remained hidden.</p>

            <h2>Why natural language matters</h2>
            <p>When people talk, they don’t use perfect rules. They use shortcuts. They say things like after dinner, tomorrow morning, or around 6. It’s not exact, but it’s good enough. That’s how the human mind works. We think in sketches, not in code</p>

            <p>You’re scrolling through messages and see a small marker: 3h ago. Your mind doesn’t even pause. Yesterday has the same effect. These little labels glide past unnoticed, like a friend giving you a quick reminder.</p>

            <p>I don’t give a shit about your product. I don’t care how it works logically, and I don’t care about your company in an ocean of competitors. I only notice what your product gives me in the moment. Sometimes that sparks a little appreciation, but it fades quickly because I’ve got other things to care about.</p>
