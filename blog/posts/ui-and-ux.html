    <h1> UI and UX - Two Sides of the <span>Same Coin</span> </h1>
</header>

<section id="blog-post">
    <ingress>The world of design has come a long way over the years. One of the biggest shifts happened when companies like Apple started to grow. Before Apple, most employers looked for UI designers—people who designed the look and layout of screens. But as Apple changed the game, a new job appeared: UX designer. Suddenly, user experience became its own focus. Now, the trend is shifting again, combining UI and UX into a single role, as it should be.</ingress>
    <ingress>Here’s why: UI doesn’t make sense without UX. A user interface that ignores the user’s experience is just a design with no purpose. These roles naturally overlap because the way something looks—its shapes, colors, and layout—affects how people interact with it.</ingress>

    <h2>A Real-Life Example</h2>
    <p>Take product packaging, for example. A graphic designer creates the look of a box or bag, making it match the brand. But they also think about how the packaging feels. How thick is the paper? Is the texture smooth or coarse? Does it open easily? Maybe there’s a little surprise inside, like a handwritten note or a piece of candy.</p>
    <p>That’s more than just design—it’s user experience. That intimate moment of the customer opening the package combines both visual impressions and and the experience. One doesn’t succeed without the other.</p>

    <h2>Bringing UI and UX Together</h2>
    <p>In any design process, UX often starts things off with wireframes or rough sketches that outline the structure. As the project moves forward, UI elements like colors, fonts, and images come into play. The best designs happen when UI and UX work together from start to finish, creating something that looks good, feels good, and works seamlessly.</p>
    <p>This is why I see UI and UX as one. Separating them doesn’t make sense—they’re part of the same journey.</p>

    <h2>Why Knowing a Bit of Everything Helps</h2>
    <p>If you’re a UI/UX designer, learning some basics of programming is a huge advantage. You don’t need to be a coding expert, but understanding how development works helps you design things that can actually be built. It also makes it easier to work with developers and solve problems as a team.</p>
    <p>At the same time, developers could benefit from learning a little about design. While that’s not always a popular idea, I believe it would make teamwork smoother and the final product even better.</p>

    <h2>The Future of UI and UX</h2>
    <p>As the gap between UI and UX shrinks, we should embrace their connection. The best designs happen when the visuals and the experience are created as one. Whether you’re a designer, developer, or business owner, understanding this connection can lead to amazing results.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just about job titles or trends. It’s about creating designs that truly connect with people—designs that look great, work perfectly, and leave a lasting impression.</p>
    <p>Isn’t that what all great design should do?</p>

            <p>When people talk, they don’t use perfect rules. They use shortcuts. They say things like after dinner, tomorrow morning, or around 6. It’s not exact, but it’s good enough. That’s how the human mind works. We think in sketches, not in code</p>
